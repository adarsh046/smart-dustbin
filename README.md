# Smart-Dustbin
Traditional dustbins require to be opened by pressing foot against its lever and then throwing waste in it, but ours is a Smart Dustbin which is controlled by a telegram bot, which approaches the user when called and it will return to its original spot on its own when the job is done.
It detects if the waste is recyclable or not and opens respective comparments for the same and a unique feature of this bin is that its motion sensor automatically opens the lid as it detects a movement around. This is a great feature, which allows you to throw the trash without having to touch the bin. The lid closes on its own as you move away from the bin. These automatic bins come with an UV sensor. The sensor activates automatically, which gets an internal motor working to open the lid automatically, as there is a movement near the bin. Thus, there is never a need to touch the bin. This feature and more make the motion sensor waste bin perfect for office spaces and modern home kitchens. 
The prototype consists of a small robot which follows a path laid out by black lines, a bin kept on the back of the robot, UV sensor, IR sensor, raspberry pi 3 model B and a battery.
